# Fractal-drawers
Developed a Java application for drawing fractals using object-oriented programming principles. Implemented fundamental data structures, including ArrayList and LinkedList, to efficiently manage shapes. Utilized recursive algorithms for drawing circle, triangle, and rectangle fractals, demonstrating strong algorithmic and data structure skills.
